**The tool was made for educational and research purposes. Does not work on Classic or other iterations of modern WoW titles. In addition, most up to date 1.12.2 emulator servers will have some form of anti-cheat in place to detect or combat some or all features of this tool. I do not take responsibility for suspended accounts nor do I condone hacking/botting in online games.** 

A WoW 1.12.2 Packet Manipulation / Multihack tool. A large portion of the tool is dedicated to sniffing and sending packets through the WoW Client. Uses Detours to hook game functions. Other features include:

* Movement Speed
* Wallclimb
* Teleport
* Dumping entity list
* Wrapped network functionality for casting spells on specific targets (specified by GUID)
* Hooked ClickToMove function.

The last two mentioned features was the beginning of a bot but the idea never came to fruition as I lost interest in the project.
